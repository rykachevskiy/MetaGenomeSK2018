General pipeline is:
1. merge biom files from several datasets into numpy array  - investigate_tables.ipynb 
2. Apply PCA to obtained data (code is lost, however simple sklearn PCA is ok)
3. The intrinsic dimension is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation Intrinsic dim estimation.ipynb
4. Non linear dimensionality reduction is applied Isomap, lle, lle m.ipynb
5. Try to cluster obtained datasets
